idea here is to eventually create a mini "real-time passenger information board" using raspeberry pi and some display - this is maximalist goal.

i did this project maybe a year ago using javascript/hmtl/css (with some bootstrap :D) just to see if i can attempt this and display the data as a webpage. i used only hardcoded static data which was not ideal...

this time im trying webscraping approach from dpmk site. i investigated some API possibilities but i found nothing completely reliable or free but i'm not ruling it out in the future. for now the plan is to make some sort of cron job that scrapes data once a day (lets say 4am) and then displays them in real time throughout the day on matrix or eInk display...

test if this still works...
